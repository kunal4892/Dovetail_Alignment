# Dovetail_Alignment
* Generate Nucleotide Sequences randomly.
* Mutate the generated sequences by a given probability.
* Align the mutated strings using the dovetail alignment and combine strings
with the highest alignment score until just one string remain or the best alignment
score within the remaining strings is negative.
